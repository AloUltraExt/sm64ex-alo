# More Objects Patch
This is a PC port of MOP originally made by Kaze, rewritten by jesusyoshi54 and AloXado320 using [mips_to_c](https://github.com/matt-kempster/mips_to_c) as code reference

## MOP 1

Original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2YQsQ4m5g

**Beta Green Shell / Beta Red Shell**

Mostly similar from the original, these are just small breakable boxes using those unused beta shell models

**Beta Trampoline**

Different from the original, it was properly finished by Kaze and nim using the leftover code, one thing i changed is that it doesn't rely on `stub_mario_step_2` anymore.

**Noteblock**

Mostly similar from the original, has missing dust/star particles but calling their behavior (like in the original) doesn't make them spawn.

**Sandblock**

Mostly similar from the original, has it's model smoothed and now it respawns like in Sunshine.

**Shrink Platform**

Mostly similar from the original, but border color is now silver like in Galaxy.

**Sonic Spring**

Mostly similar from the original, although there could be some velocity differences if you hold A.

**Beta Blargg**

Different from the original, it was properly finished by Kaze in his splitscreen project (code and textures)
