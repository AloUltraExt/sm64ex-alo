## Building
 ### Clone the repository:

 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/AloXado320/sm64ex-alo
 cd sm64ex-alo
 ```
 
 **Note:** On Unix systems you may need to do this before doing any changes:
 
 ```sh
 git config core.fileMode false
 chmod -R 777 .
 ```
 
 ### Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction:
 
 For each version (jp/us/eu/sh) for which you want to build an executable, put an existing ROM at `./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.
 
 By default it builds the US version.
